1.  Measure performance
    a) Just capturing, at each color depth
    b) Of each step (e.g. filter, contours, etc)
    c) Of the 'clear' step; see how much that is costing

2.  Test different blurs
    a) Visual, and performance

3.  Experiment with contour finds
    a) Not really doing contours right yet

4.  Add a light on/light off snapshot mode
