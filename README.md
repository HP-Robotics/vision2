Vision2
======

Team 2823 Vision processing code for Raspberry Pi + OpenCV.

This set of code is not especially compelling.  It was
developed primarily to allow an aging mentor to work with
performance issues, to see if we can squeeze our FPS up.

Main features:
  * most code in C
  * direct camera import code, can filter + grayscale in line
  * yuv filtering
  * optional toggles for various filters
  * prints time stats
